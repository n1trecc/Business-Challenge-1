# Business-Challenge-1

A Wells Fargo sponsored course.
The client assigned to us was Israel Englander of Millenium Management.

Creating a SQL database that represents the relationships of the different business divisions within Wells Fargo wealth management.
Setting up dataframes and visualizing an Entity Relationship Diagram and loading in the created data for each division through DDL's.
Data was either generated in Python or pulled from sources such as YahooFinance and AlphaVantage.

The rest of this challenge was open-ended to allow for analysis into the portfolio of Mr Englander and any recommendations for his portftolio.
Our analysis consisted of a current portfolio analysis, risk metrics and portfolio optimization, all done in python.

Portfolio optimization code looked into Modern Portfolio Theory, specifically using beta and expected return to suggest a new approach, as well
as mean variance optimization using a covariance matrix with Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage, mapping an efficent frontier and suggesting a long/short 
80/20 approach for the hedge fund to adopt.
